              I taught ReactJS and frontend technologies at CSIT Software
              Training Centre for one year, where I developed an easy-to-learn,
              comprehensive curriculum. My efforts were praised for making React
              more accessible and understandable, leading to successful learning
              outcomes for students. This recognition stands as a testament to
              my teaching skills and dedication. ðŸš€
